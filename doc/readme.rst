HANS
====

|PyPI version| |CI| |Coverage|

This code implements the Height-Averaged Navier-Stokes (HANS) scheme for
two-dimensional lubrication problems as described in the following
paper:

`Holey, H. et al. (2022) Tribology Letters, 70(2),
p. 36. <https://doi.org/10.1007/s11249-022-01576-5>`__

Installation
------------

Packaged versions can be installed via

::

   pip install hans

Multiscale simulations require a working installation of
`LAMMPS <https://www.lammps.org/#gsc.tab=0>`__. New molecular dynamics
runs are triggered using the Python interface of LAMMPS. Therefore
LAMMPS has to be build as a shared library. Please follow the
installation instructions of
`LAMMPS <https://docs.lammps.org/Python_install.html>`__.

Examples
--------

Run from the command line with

::

   mpirun -n <NP> python3 -m hans -i <input_file> [-p] [-r <restart_file>]

where ``NP`` is the number of MPI processes. The plot option (``-p``,
``--plot``) is only available for serial execution. Example input files
as well as jupyter-notebooks can be found in the
`examples <examples/>`__ directory.

The command line interface contains some scripts for plotting and
creating animations. For instance, 1D profiles of converged solutions
can be displayed with

::

   plot1D_last.py

Tests
-----

Run all tests from the main source directory with

::

   pytest

or append the path to the test definition file (located in
`tests <tests>`__) to run selected tests only.

Documentation
-------------

A Sphinx-generated documentation can be built locally with

::

   cd doc
   sphinx-apidoc -o . ../hans
   make html
