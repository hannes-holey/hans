def heat_equation_1d(L, c_v, k, rho, T_max, x_vec, t_vec):
    """Analytical solution for the 1D heat equation.

    Solves the heat equation with Dirichlet T=0 boundary conditions
    at both ends (x=0 and x=L) and an initial condition of
    T(x,0) = T_max * sin(pi*x/L).

    The solution is:
        T(x,t) = T_max * exp(-lambda^2 * t) * sin(pi*x/L)

    where lambda = sqrt(alpha) * pi/L and alpha = k/(c_v*rho).

    Parameters
    ----------
    L : float
        Domain length
    c_v : float
        Specific heat capacity
    k : float
        Thermal conductivity
    rho : float
        Density
    T_max : float
        Maximum initial temperature (amplitude of sine wave)
    x_vec : array_like
        Spatial coordinates, shape (nx,)
    t_vec : array_like
        Time values, shape (nt,)

    Returns
    -------
    T_mat : ndarray
        Temperature field, shape (nt, nx), where T_mat[i, j] = T(x_vec[j], t_vec[i])
