Linear system scaling for FEM solver conditioning.

This module provides scaling utilities to improve the conditioning of the
linear systems arising from Newton iteration in the FEM solver.

The transformation is:
    J*[i,j] = J[i,j] · D_q[j] / D_R[i]
    R*[i] = R[i] / D_R[i]
    dq[j] = dq*[j] · D_q[j]

where D_q and D_R are characteristic scales for variables and residuals.
