# GaPFlow
*Gap-averaged flow simulations with Gaussian Process regression.*

This code implements the solution of time-dependent lubrication problems as
described in:
- [Holey, H. et al., Tribology Letters 70 (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11249-022-01576-5)

The extension to atomistic-continuum multiscale simulations with Gaussian
process (GP) surrogate models has been described in:
- [Holey, H. et al., Science Advances 11, eadx4546 (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adx4546)

The code uses [µGrid](https://muspectre.github.io/muGrid/) for handling
macroscale fields and [tinygp](https://tinygp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
as GP library. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations run with [LAMMPS](https://docs.lammps.org)
through its [Python interface](https://docs.lammps.org/Python_head.html). Elastic
deformation is computed using [ContactMechanics](https://contactengineering.github.io/ContactMechanics/).

## Installation

`GaPFlow` can be installed via
```
pip install GaPFlow
```
A serial build of LAMMPS is provided for most platforms which allows testing
all of `GaPFlow`'s functionality. For production simulations it is however
recommended to build GaPFlow with parallel LAMMPS on your system.
You need to have MPI installed (e.g. via `apt install openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev`
on Debian-based systems). To compile for your specific platform, run
```
pip install --no-binary GaPFlow GaPFlow[parallel]
```

You can check your installation by running `gpf_info` from the command line.
```

We currently do not use parallel functionalities of µGrid, so MPI support is not
required.

For installations from source, do not forget to initialize the LAMMPS submodule after cloning the repository
```
git submodule update --init
```


## Minimal example
Simulation inputs are commonly provided in YAML files. A typical input file
might look like this:

```yaml
# examples/journal.yaml
options:
    output: data/journal
    write_freq: 10
grid:
    dx: 1.e-5
    dy: 1.
    Nx: 100
    Ny: 1
    xE: ['D', 'N', 'N']
    xW: ['D', 'N', 'N']
    yS: ['P', 'P', 'P']
    yN: ['P', 'P', 'P']
    xE_D: 877.7007
    xW_D: 877.7007
geometry:
    type: journal
    CR: 1.e-2
    eps: 0.7
    U: 0.1
    V: 0.
numerics:
    tol: 1e-9
    dt: 1e-10
    max_it: 200
properties:
    shear: 0.0794
    bulk: 0.
    EOS: DH
    P0: 101325
    rho0: 877.7007
    T0: 323.15
    C1: 3.5e10
    C2: 1.23
```

Note that this example uses fixed-form constitutive laws without GP surrogate
models or MD data. More example input files can be found in the [examples]
(examples/) directory.

The input files can be used to start a simulation from the command line
```bash
python -m GaPFlow -i my_input_file.yaml
```
or from a Python script
```python
from GaPFlow.problem import Problem

myProblem = Problem.from_yaml('my_input_file.yaml')
myProblem.run()
```
Simulation output is stored under the location specified in the input file.
After successful completion, you should find the following files.
- `config.yml`: A sanitized version of your simulation input.
- `topo.nc`: NetCDF file containing the gap height and gradients.
- `sol.nc`: NetCDF file containing the solution and stress fields.
- `history.csv`: Contains the time series of scalar quantities (step, Ekin,
  residual, ...)
- `gp_[xz,yz,zz].csv` (Optional): Contains the time series of GP hyperparameters,
  database size, etc.
- `Xtrain.npy` (Optional): Training data inputs
- `Ytrain.npy` (Optional): Training data observations
- `Ytrain_err.npy` (Optional): Training data observation error

The code comes with a few handy [command line tools](GaPFlow/cli/) for
visualizations like this one

which shows the transient solution of a 1D journal bearing with active learning
of the constitutive behavior.
